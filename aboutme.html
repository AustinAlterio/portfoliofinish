				Whats up? My name is Austin Alterio and I'm 21 years old. I am pursing a career in 3D animation and motion graphics. I am fairly new to this field of work and am putting in hours everyday to learn more and more. I've attended the University of Maryland for a year and the University of Connecticut for two years. I hope to graduate from UCONN in 2016 with a BFA in Digital Media and Design.

				I have a firm belief that those who are most passionate about what they do are the best at what they do. I love animation and even from a young age I was always fascinated by it. I thoroughly enjoy what I do and to me it doesn't feel like work.
